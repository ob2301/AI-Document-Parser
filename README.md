# AI-Document-Parser
A web app that parses data from (now Spotify API) and sorts/obfuscates based on user request. 

Still developing guardrails and API calls, as this was previously a project for Forum Systems, but since it was under an NDA I didn't want to take the risk and copy the code, so I am re creating it this time for the purposes I stated above.

Structure (as of now, thinking to implement changes tho)
public - index.html

source - app.js, quiz,js, api.js(openAI API), index.js, style.css

pckge.json
